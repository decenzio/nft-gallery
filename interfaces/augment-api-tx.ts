       * - If the origin is `root`, both the main and fallback calls are executed without
       * applying any origin filters.
       * - If the origin is not `root`, the origin filter is applied to both the `main` and
       * `fallback` calls.
       *
       * ## Use Case
       * - Some use cases might involve submitting a `batch` type call in either main, fallback
       * or both.
